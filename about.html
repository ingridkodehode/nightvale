            The Moonlite All-Nite Diner is a diner located in Night Vale, next
            to the Desert Flower Bowling Alley and Arcade Fun Complex on Route
            800. The diner ia a typical small-town diner, complete with neon
            lighting, outdated decor, and sub-par food, although it still seems
            to enjoy a small measure of success. The Moonlite All-Nite's fare
            has been described as food that "sounds good only late at night,"
            and likewise, the diner itself has been described as "a glass box of
            bad food and good people."

          <p>
            Citizens are not even supposed to be consciously aware of the dog
            park, so they could not possibly be receiving a menacing and
            unearthly voice instructing listeners to bring precious metals and
            toddlers to the dog park! DOG PARK, that could NEVER, EVER BE REAL.
